<h2><u><center>About my work</center></u></h2>
<p style="font-family:arial"><center>I make films about issues in society and the economy.<br> A lot of my work have an aggresive approach towards the topic and have deeper meanings engraved in them.<br> I spend a lot of my time working on the philosophy behind every one of my films and how each the frames relate to the topic in hand.<br> My goal is the make the audience think about the issues that lie beneath the sugar coating of society.<br></center></p>
